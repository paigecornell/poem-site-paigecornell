<h1> Trees</h1>

<p>I think that I shall never see
a poem lovely as a tree.</p>

<p>A tree whose hungry mouth is prest
against the earth's sweet flowing breast;</p>

<p>A tree that looks at God all day,
and lifts her leafy arms to pray;</p>

<p>A tree that may in Summer wear
a nest of robins in her hair;</p>

<p>Upon whose bosom snow has lain;
Who intimately lives with rain.</p>

<p>Poems are made by fools like me,
but only God can make a tree.</p>
